To Do:
- Done - Multiple permission levels for edit functionality.

- Data validation when editing employee fields.

- Scrolling for all emps report.

- Update "readme.txt"!

- Update to PEP 8 standards.

- Real-time updating of data when edited.
   - Along with this, run all emp report, so pay stubs are correct.

- Done - Archiving employees - add to GUI
- Do we want a way to unarchive an employee record?
- Should we delete employee records from the "employees.csv" record?
   (They're still in "archived.csv".)

- For docs: tell Gabe that username is no longer being used, only user ID.
This may apply for the functional requirements, at least.


- Implement editing functionality in both GUI and database.
   - Can we edit employee in the GUI?
        - Do we want to use the "File" dropdown, or change the labels to
          fields?
   - Is database file rewritten when we edit them and save?

- Done - Implement the creating of new employees using the GUI.
   - Make sure they are properly stored in the database.

- Implement archiving of employees in the GUI (and the database).
   - The database has methods now, but we need to integrate it with the
     GUI.

- Done - Put button for report for all employees on the admin employee list page.

- Add a GUI screen when admin is generating report for all employees
  (.csv file is working).
   - Scrolling has been confusing on this one.

- Clarify how we will be keeping track of admin permissions.
   - Currently, an employee.permission data member is being used.

- Done - Organize the files to be more modular and testable.

- Attach the readme to the "Help -> Help" dropdown.

- Work with Gabriel to write and perform test cases, and record bugs.

- Fix bugs.
