To Do:

- Implement editing functionality in both GUI and database.
   - Can we edit employee in the GUI?
        - Do we want to use the "File" dropdown, or change the labels to
          fields?
   - Is database file rewritten when we edit them and save?

- Implement the creating of new employees using the GUI.
   - Make sure they are properly stored in the database.

- Implement archiving of employees in the GUI (and the database).

- Put button for report for all employees on the admin employee list page.

- Add a GUI screen when admin is generating report for all employees
  (.csv file is working).
   - Scrolling has been confusing on this one.

- Clarify how we will be keeping track of admin permissions.
   - Currently, an employee.permission data member is being used.

- Organize the files to be more modular and testable.

- Attach the readme to the "Help -> Help" dropdown.

- Work with Gabriel to write and perform test cases, and record bugs.

- Fix bugs.
